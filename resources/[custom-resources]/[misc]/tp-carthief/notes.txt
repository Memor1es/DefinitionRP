Its a fucking mess. XD

Need to optimize the way it knows each of the stages you are at:
1. Before you even speak to Raymond
2. After speaking with Raymond, waiting for a job
3. Job comes in, but you're not near the car
4. You're near the car, start the police tracking blips
5. After 5 minutes, tracker is deactivated
6. Take the car to a location, you must get there and it takes about 60 seconds for the door to open (So you must have lost cops)
